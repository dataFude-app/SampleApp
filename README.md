# dataTile for Simulator â€” SampleApp

A simple SwiftUI project that uses `os_log` to log some of the view state to the Xcode console. Build and run, then scroll up and down and select some of the list items to see the data pop up in dataTile's window:

> Note: The pre-run phase launches dataTile automatically so you should be able to just build and run without needing to do anything else (given you have dataTile installed).

If you don't have dataTile for Simulator installed you can get the free version from the Mac App Store: https://underplot.com/dataTile
